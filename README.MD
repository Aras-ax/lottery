## Docker Deployment plan

### Summary

This project is support to deploy by Docker. Docker is a platform with lightweight containerization, allows you to quickly deploy, test and run the applications. This text will introduce how to deploy the project by Docker.

### System Requirement

Before you use the Docker to deploy the project, you need to ensure you have download below software:

- Docker (Please refer Docker official file to get the installation instructions)
- Docker Compose

### Installation

1. Download and unzip the source code for the project

2. Access the project directory after unzipped the file

3. Execute the following command to build the Docker mirror image:

   ```
   ./build.sh [TAG]
   ```

   It will use Dockerfile to set up the Docker mirror image named `lottery:[TAG]`. If no tag is specified, the 'latest' tag is used by default
   
4. Execute the following command to run the local container:

   ```
   ./dev.sh [TAG]
   ```

   This will start the container and deploy the application in the Docker container. You can test loacally to ensure all running fulently.  
Please be pay attention that all applicaiton in the container will monitor port 8888 and port 443.

5. Execute the following command to tag the Docker mirror image and push it to the remote Docker repository

   ```
   ./tagpush.sh [TAG]
   ```

   It will tag the Docker mirror image and push it to the remote Docker repository, please build up your repo at https://hub.docker.com/ if you want to us Docker official hub.

6. Ensure it has a file named `docker-compose.yml` and add below information:

   ```
   version: '3.8'
   
   volumes:
     lottery_log:
   
   services:
     lottery:
       container_name: lottery
       expose:
         - 8888
       ports:
         - "28458:8888"
         - "443:443"
       volumes:
         - "lottery_log:/var/log"
       image: "panda1024/lottery:[TAG]" 
       restart: always
   ```

  Kindly take note that `[TAG]` should be replaced with the name of the mirror image you pushed to the Docker repository

7. Run the following command in the project directory on the server to deploy the application using Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start a Docker Compose stack and deploy the project into it. Note that port 8888 and port 443 of the container are mapped to port 8888 and port 443 on the server. If you wish to use a different port, please change the `docker-compose.yml` file accordingly.
